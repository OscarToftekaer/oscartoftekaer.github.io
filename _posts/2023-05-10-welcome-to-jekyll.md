By the end of 2010, England was home to more than 52 million people [<a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/bulletins/annualmidyearpopulationestimates/2013-12-17"> 1</a>] and almost 30 million vehicles [<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/vehicle-licensing-statistics-data-tables#all-vehicles"> 2</a>]. Unfortunately, this makes traffic accidents inevitable. In fact, between 2005 and 2010, on average almost 3.5 people were seriously injured in a traffic accident in England every day! It is therefore highly relevant to explore data concerning traffic accidents nationwide. This data story covers traffic accidents in England from 2005 to 2010.



## Watch out in Birmingham and Manchester! Or?
Do you ever wonder where in England traffic is most dangerous? Let’s look into it. England is divided into 335 local authority districts. The map below shows us the most dangerous districts to get into traffic. Try and zoom in on the areas you think are the most dangerous!

This map makes it clear that we need to look twice before we cross the road in Birmingham and Manchester. But is that the whole story? Did you try to zoom in on the London districts? They really don’t look very dramatic. But considering the fact that the capital city has a population of more than 5 times the populations of Birmingham and Manchester combined [<a href="https://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester"> 3</a>], [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birmingham"> 4</a>], [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/London"> 5</a>], surely we would expect to see a hotspot for traffic accidents here. Let’s have a look at the number of accidents across the 10 most populous cities in England:
