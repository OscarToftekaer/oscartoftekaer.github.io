The dataset used on this website is called “UK Road Safety: Traffic Accidents and Vehicles” and can be found <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tsiaras/uk-road-safety-accidents-and-vehicles?datasetId=43428&sortBy=voteCount"> here</a>. It is split into a dataset containing information about the accident, which we will call the accident data, and another dataset containing information about the vehicle and the driver called the vehicle data. The accident data tells us everything we need to know regarding the date and time, coordinates, road type, and the severity of the accident, whereas the vehicle data tells us the age and gender of the driver and the maneuver that caused the accident (among other things). Both datasets also feature a unique accident index, which makes it possible to merge them and they range from 2005 to 2010.
